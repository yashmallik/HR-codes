# Task
# Given a base-10 integer, n, convert it to binary (base-2). Then find and print the base-10 integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 1's in n's binary representation. When working with different bases, it is common to show the base as a subscript.
# 
# Example
# n=125

# The binary representation of 125 is 1111101 . In base 10, there are 5 and 1 consecutive ones in two groups. Print the maximum, 5.
