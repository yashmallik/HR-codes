# Task
# A Node class is provided for you in the editor. A Node object has an integer data field, Data, and a Node instance pointer, next, pointing to another node (i.e.: the next node in a list).

# A removeDuplicates function is declared in your editor, which takes a pointer to the head node of a linked list as a parameter. Complete removeDuplicates so that it deletes any duplicate nodes from the list and returns the head of the updated list.

# Note: The head pointer may be null, indicating that the list is empty. Be sure to reset your next pointer when performing deletions to avoid breaking the list.
