# Objective
# Today, we're getting started with Exceptions by learning how to parse an integer from a string and print a custom error message. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

# Task
# Read a string, S, and print its integer value; if S cannot be converted to an integer, print Bad String.

# Note: You must use the String-to-Integer and exception handling constructs built into your submission language. If you attempt to use loops/conditional statements, you will get a 0 score.

# Input Format

# A single string, S.

import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys


try:
    S = int(input())
    print(S)
except:
    print("Bad String")
