# Objective
# In this challenge, we learn about conditional statements. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video.

# Task
# Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:

# If n is odd, print Weird
# If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
# If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
# If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird
# Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not n is weird.
